Yes, there are ways to avoid running your Python script from the beginning every time, especially when you're frequently adding new functions or making changes. Here are some approaches you can take:

---

### **1. Use a `main()` Function and Conditional Execution**
You can structure your script to only run specific parts based on a condition. For example:

#### **Refactor Your Script**
Move your code into a `main()` function and use a flag or conditional logic to control which sections of the script execute.

```python
def load_data():
    print("Loading data...")
    # Simulate data loading
    return {"data": "sample data"}

def process_data(data):
    print("Processing data...")
    # Simulate data processing
    return {"processed_data": data}

def new_function(data):
    print("Running the new function...")
    # Simulate new functionality
    return {"result": data}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set a flag to control execution
    run_new_function_only = True

    if not run_new_function_only:
        data = load_data()
        processed_data = process_data(data)
    else:
        processed_data = {"processed_data": "sample data"}  # Mock previous steps

    result = new_function(processed_data)
    print(result)
```

#### **How This Helps**
- You can toggle the `run_new_function_only` flag to skip earlier steps and test your new function directly.
- Mock previous steps with sample outputs to save time.

---

### **2. Use `pickle` or `joblib` to Save Intermediate Results**
You can save the results of earlier steps to disk and load them directly when rerunning the script. This avoids redoing expensive operations like data loading or preprocessing.

#### **Save Results**
```python
import pickle

def load_data():
    print("Loading data...")
    data = {"data": "sample data"}
    with open("data.pkl", "wb") as f:
        pickle.dump(data, f)
    return data

def process_data(data):
    print("Processing data...")
    processed_data = {"processed_data": data}
    with open("processed_data.pkl", "wb") as f:
        pickle.dump(processed_data, f)
    return processed_data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = load_data()
    processed_data = process_data(data)
```

#### **Load Saved Results**
```python
import pickle

def new_function(data):
    print("Running the new function...")
    return {"result": data}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load previously saved data
    with open("processed_data.pkl", "rb") as f:
        processed_data = pickle.load(f)

    result = new_function(processed_data)
    print(result)
```

#### **How This Helps**
- Save intermediate outputs (e.g., loaded or processed data) to files.
- Load these files instead of re-executing earlier steps.

---

### **3. Use a Python Debugger (`pdb`)**
You can use the Python debugger to run the script interactively and skip to specific parts without restarting.

#### **Add Breakpoints**
Insert the following line where you want to start debugging:
```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

#### **Run the Script**
When the script reaches the breakpoint, it pauses execution, and you can interactively execute the remaining functions:
```bash
$ python your_script.py
(Pdb) processed_data = {"processed_data": "sample data"}
(Pdb) result = new_function(processed_data)
(Pdb) print(result)
(Pdb) continue
```

#### **How This Helps**
- You can manually skip steps and directly test new functions.
- This is useful for debugging and quick iteration.

---

### **4. Use Jupyter Notebook**
If your workflow involves frequent testing and iteration, consider using **Jupyter Notebook** instead of a `.py` file. Jupyter allows you to run specific cells without restarting the entire script.

#### **Steps**
1. Convert your `.py` file into a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) using:
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --to notebook your_script.py
   ```
2. Open the notebook and split your code into cells. Run only the cells that correspond to the new functions you're testing.

#### **How This Helps**
- You can skip earlier steps and focus on the latest functions.
- You can interactively test, tweak, and visualize results.

---

### **5. Modularize Your Code**
Split your script into multiple modules (separate `.py` files) and import only the parts you need.

#### **Example**
Create separate files for loading, processing, and new functionality:
- `load_data.py`
- `process_data.py`
- `new_function.py`

#### **Main Script**
```python
from load_data import load_data
from process_data import process_data
from new_function import new_function

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Skip earlier steps if already done
    processed_data = {"processed_data": "sample data"}  # Mock data
    result = new_function(processed_data)
    print(result)
```

#### **How This Helps**
- Modularization lets you isolate functionality and run only the parts you need.
- You can test individual modules independently.

---

### **6. Use `__cache__` Variables**
Store intermediate results in global variables or cache them in memory.

#### **Example**
```python
_cache = {}

def load_data():
    if "data" in _cache:
        print("Using cached data...")
        return _cache["data"]
    print("Loading data...")
    data = {"data": "sample data"}
    _cache["data"] = data
    return data

def process_data(data):
    if "processed_data" in _cache:
        print("Using cached processed data...")
        return _cache["processed_data"]
    print("Processing data...")
    processed_data = {"processed_data": data}
    _cache["processed_data"] = processed_data
    return processed_data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = load_data()
    processed_data = process_data(data)
    print(processed_data)
```

#### **How This Helps**
- Cache intermediate results in memory for faster re-execution.
- Avoid reloading or reprocessing data unnecessarily.

---

### **7. Use `pytest` for Unit Testing**
Write unit tests for individual functions to test them independently without running the entire script.

#### **Example**
```python
import pytest
from your_script import new_function

def test_new_function():
    processed_data = {"processed_data": "sample data"}
    result = new_function(processed_data)
    assert result == {"result": "sample data"}
```

Run the tests:
```bash
pytest test_your_script.py
```

#### **How This Helps**
- Test individual functions without running the entire script.
- Automate testing for faster iteration.

---

### **Conclusion**
To avoid re-running your script from the beginning:
1. Use conditional execution (`if` statements) to skip earlier steps.
2. Save and load intermediate results using `pickle` or similar tools.
3. Use debugging tools like `pdb` or switch to Jupyter Notebook for interactive execution.
4. Modularize your code for better isolation and reusability.

# Running code up to a certain point

Running a Python script up to a certain line can be achieved in a few ways depending on your workflow. Here are some approaches:

---

### **1. Use a Python Debugger (`pdb`)**
The Python debugger (`pdb`) allows you to pause execution at a specific line and interactively run code from there.

#### **Steps**:
1. Insert a breakpoint at the desired line using:
   ```python
   import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
3. When execution reaches the breakpoint, the script will pause, and you'll enter an interactive debugging session.
4. In the debugger, you can inspect variables, run code, or skip further execution:
   - `c`: Continue execution.
   - `q`: Quit the debugger.

---

### **2. Comment Out Code Below the Desired Line**
You can temporarily comment out the lines of code below the point where you want execution to stop.

#### **Example**:
```python
# Code up to the desired line
print("Loading data...")
data = {"key": "value"}

# Temporarily comment out code below
# print("Processing data...")
# processed_data = process_data(data)
```

Run the script, and it will stop at the last uncommented line.

---

### **3. Use Conditional Logic**
Add a flag or condition to your script to control execution.

#### **Example**:
```python
run_up_to_line = True

print("Loading data...")
data = {"key": "value"}

if run_up_to_line:
    print("Stopping execution here.")
    exit()

print("Processing data...")
processed_data = process_data(data)
```

Set `run_up_to_line = True` to stop execution at the desired line.

---

### **4. Use a Jupyter Notebook**
If you're frequently testing parts of your script, convert it into a Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter allows you to run specific cells instead of the entire script.

#### **Steps**:
1. Install Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. Convert your `.py` file to a notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --to notebook your_script.py
   ```
3. Open the notebook and split your code into cells. Run only the cells up to the desired line.

---

### **5. Use `try`/`except` to Force Early Termination**
You can use `try`/`except` to stop execution at a specific line by raising a custom exception.

#### **Example**:
```python
try:
    print("Loading data...")
    data = {"key": "value"}
    raise SystemExit("Stopping execution here.")  # Stop execution
    print("Processing data...")
except SystemExit as e:
    print(e)
```

When the `SystemExit` exception is raised, the script will stop.

---

### **6. Use `sys.exit()`**
You can explicitly stop the script at any point using `sys.exit()`.

#### **Example**:
```python
import sys

print("Loading data...")
data = {"key": "value"}

sys.exit("Stopping execution here.")  # Stops the script
print("Processing data...")
```

---

### **7. Use IDE Debugging Tools**
Most IDEs (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code) provide debugging tools that allow you to set breakpoints and run the script up to a specific line.

#### **Steps in VS Code**:
1. Open your script in VS Code.
2. Set a breakpoint on the desired line by clicking next to the line number.
3. Start debugging by pressing **F5**.
4. The script will pause at the breakpoint, and you can inspect variables or step through the remaining code.

---

### **8. Use `slice` in Loops or Data Processing**
If your script involves loops or data processing, you can use slicing to limit execution to a subset of data.

#### **Example**:
```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Process only the first 3 items
for item in data[:3]:
    print(item)
```

---

### **Conclusion**
The best approach depends on your workflow:
- Use `pdb` or IDE debugging tools for interactive control.
- Use `sys.exit()` or conditional logic for quick and simple termination.
- Use Jupyter Notebook for iterative development.
