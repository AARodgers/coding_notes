Task:
Create a script called backup.sh which runs every day and automatically backs up any encrypted password files that have been updated in the past 24 hours.

There are a total of 20 points to be earned for 17 tasks in this final project.
Your grade will be based on the following tasks within the hands-on lab:

[Tasks 1-13]: Upload screenshot of sections from the backup.sh script displaying the correct code (13 pts: 1 pt for each of the 13 tasks)
[Task 14]: Submit your completed backup.sh file (1 pt)
[Task 15]: Upload screenshot showing executable permissions (2 pts)
[Task 16]: Upload screenshot showing file named backup-[TIMESTAMP].tar.gz (2 pts)
[Task 17]: Upload screenshot showing crontab schedule of once every day (2 pts)

Task 0:
Download the template file backup.sh by running the command below:data_
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/pWN3kO2yWEuKMvYJdcLPQg/backup.sh






#!/bin/bash

# Task 1: Set variables from command line arguments
targetDirectory=$1
destinationDirectory=$2

# ---

# Task 2: Display the values of the two variables
echo "Target Directory: $targetDirectory"
echo "Destination Directory: $destinationDirectory"

# ---

# Task 3: Define currentTS as the current timestamp in seconds
currentTS=$(date +%s)

# ---

# Task 4: Define backupFileName
backupFileName="backup-$currentTS.tar.gz"

# ---

# Task 5: Define origAbsPath with the absolute path of the current directory
origAbsPath=$(pwd)

# ---

# Task 6: Define destAbsPath and validate the directory
cd "$destinationDirectory" || exit # Change to the destination directory, or exit if it fails
destAbsPath=$(pwd)             # Get its absolute path

# (Optional: Change back to the original directory for subsequent tasks)
# cd "$origAbsPath"


# TASK 17
# copy (use full path to your script)
sudo cp "/Users/amandarodgers/code/coding_notes/final_shell_project/backup3.sh" /usr/local/bin/backup3.sh

# ensure it's executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup3.sh

# verify
ls -l /usr/local/bin/backup3.sh
which backup3.sh || echo "/usr/local/bin is in PATH?"

use this:
sudo cp ./backup.sh /usr/local/bin/backup.sh

Please note that since the Theia Lab is a virtual environment, we need to explicitly start the cron service using the below command:
# add/edit crontab interactively
crontab -e
# then add the line:
*/1 * * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh /home/project/important-documents /home/project >> /home/project/backup.log 2>&1

Test the cronjob to see if the backup script is getting triggered by scheduling it for every 1 minute.

*/1 * * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh /home/project/important-documents /home/project

# ensure cron service is running (you already started it)
sudo service cron status

# ensure the script is executable and in place
ls -l /usr/local/bin/backup.sh

# watch cron logs (Ubuntu /cloud labs)
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep CRON
# or
sudo journalctl -u cron --since "5 minutes ago"

In nano:

Save (write file): Ctrl+O, then Enter to confirm filename
Exit: Ctrl+X
Alternate: Press Ctrl+X first — nano will ask "Save modified buffer?" — press Y to save, N to discard, then Enter to confirm filename.

After exiting, verify the crontab was saved:

crontab -l

# run daily at 00:00 (midnight)
0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh /home/project/important-documents /home/project >> /home/project/backup.log 2>&1
