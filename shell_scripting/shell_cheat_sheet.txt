Module 3 Cheat Sheet - Introduction to Shell Scripting
Bash shebang
#!/bin/bash










Get the path to a command
which bash










Pipes, filters, and chaining
Chain filter commands together using the pipe operator:
ls | sort -r










Pipe the output of manual page for ls to head to display the first 20 lines:
man ls | head -20










Use a pipeline to extract a column of names from a csv and drop duplicate names:
cut -d "," -f1 names.csv | sort | uniq










Working with shell and environment variables:
List all shell variables:
set










Define a shell variable called my_planet and assign value Earth to it:
my_planet=Earth










Display value of a shell variable:
echo $my_planet










Reading user input into a shell variable at the command line:
read first_name










Tip: Whatever text string you enter after running this command gets stored as the value of the variable first_name.

List all environment variables:
env










Environment vars: define/extend variable scope to child processes:
export my_planet
export my_galaxy='Milky Way'










Metacharacters
Comments #:
# The shell will not respond to this message










Command separator ;:
echo 'here are some files and folders'; ls










File name expansion wildcard *:
ls *.json










Single character wildcard ?:
ls file_2021-06-??.json










Quoting
Single quotes '' - interpret literally:
echo 'My home directory can be accessed by entering: echo $HOME'










Double quotes "" - interpret literally, but evaluate metacharacters:
echo "My home directory is $HOME"










Backslash \ - escape metacharacter interpretation:
echo "This dollar sign should render: \$"










I/O Redirection
Redirect output to file and overwrite any existing content:
echo 'Write this text to file x' > x










Append output to file:
echo 'Add this line to file x' >> x










Redirect standard error to file:
bad_command_1 2> error.log










Append standard error to file:
bad_command_2 2>> error.log










Redirect file contents to standard input:
$ tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" < a_text_file.txt










The input redirection above is equivalent to:
$cat a_text_file.txt | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"










Command Substitution
Capture output of a command and echo its value:
THE_PRESENT=$(date)
echo "There is no time like $THE_PRESENT"










Capture output of a command and echo its value:
echo "There is no time like $(date)"










Command line arguments
./My_Bash_Script.sh arg1 arg2 arg3










Batch vs. concurrent modes
Run commands sequentially:
start=$(date); ./MyBigScript.sh ; end=$(date)










Run commands in parallel:
./ETL_chunk_one_on_these_nodes.sh  & ./ETL_chunk_two_on_those_nodes.sh










Scheduling jobs with cron
Open crontab editor:
crontab -e










Job scheduling syntax:
m  h  dom  mon  dow   command
 (minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week)

Tip: You can use the * wildcard to mean "any".

Append the date/time to a file every Sunday at 6:15 pm:
15 18 * * 0 date >> sundays.txt










Run a shell script on the first minute of the first day of each month:
1  0 1 * * ./My_Shell_Script.sh










Back up your home directory every Monday at 3:00 am:
0 3 * * 1  tar -cvf my_backup_path\my_archive.tar.gz $HOME\










Deploy your cron job:
Close the crontab editor and save the file.

List all cron jobs:
crontab -l










Conditionals
if-then-else syntax:
if [[ $# == 2 ]]
then
  echo "number of arguments is equal to 2"
else
  echo "number of arguments is not equal to 2"
fi
 'and' operator &&:
if [ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]
 'or' operator ||:
if [ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ]










Logical operators
Operator	Definition
==	is equal to
!=	is not equal to
<	is less than
>	is greater than
<=	is less than or equal to
>=	is greater than or equal to
Arithmetic calculations
Integer arithmetic notation:
$(())










Basic arithmetic operators:
Symbol	Operation
+	addition
-	subtraction
*	multiplication
/	division
Display the result of adding 3 and 2:
echo $((3+2))










Negate a number:
echo $((-1*-2))










Arrays
Declare an array that contains items 1, 2, "three", "four", and 5:
my_array=(1 2 "three" "four" 5)










Add an item to your array:
my_array+="six"
my_array+=7










Declare an array and load it with lines of text from a file:
my_array=($(echo $(cat column.txt)))










for loops
Use a for loop to iterate over values from 1 to 5:
for i in {0..5}; do
    echo "this is iteration number $i"











Use a for loop to print all items in an array:
for item in ${my_array[@]}; do
  echo $item











Use array indexing within a for loop, assuming the array has seven elements:
for i in {0..6}; do
    echo ${my_array[$i]}
