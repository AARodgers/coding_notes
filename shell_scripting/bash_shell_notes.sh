# for commenting
; - separate commands typed on same line
# Example: will return commands on two lines
echo "hello world"; whoami

* is filename expansion wildcard
# example: ls /bin/ba* will return all files in /bin starting with ba
#output: bash

? is single character wildcard
# example: ls /bin/b??h will return all files in /bin starting with b and ending with h with two characters in between
#output: bash, bsh, bzh

# Use backslash \ to escape special characters such as space, tab and $ (preserves their literal meaning)
\ - escape special characters and spaces
# Example: echo "hello\ world" will print hello world instead of interpreting the space as a command separator
# Example: echo "hello\*world" will print hello*world instead of expanding the
# example: echo "\$1 each" will print $1 each instead of expanding $1 to the first argument passed to the script

" " - will interpret everything literally except $, `, \ and ! (metacharacters still keep their meaning_)
' ' - will interpret everything literally except \ (only when followed by another single quote or back
# example: echo "$1 each" will return 'each' because it thinks $1 is an empty variable
# example: '$1 each' will return $1 each literally, same as "\$1 each"
` ` - command substitution, runs the command inside and returns the output


I/O redirection:
Input/output (IO) redirection is the process of directing the flow of data between a program and its input/output sources.
By default, a program reads input from standard input, the keyboard, and writes output to standard output, the terminal.
However, using IO redirection, you can redirect a program's input or output to or from a file or another program.
> - redirect standard output to a file, overwriting the file if it exists
>> - ( avoids overwriting output to file)redirect standard output to a file, appending to the file if it exists ()
2> - redirect standard error to a file, overwriting the file if it exists
2>> - redirect standard error to a file, appending to the file if it exists
< - redirect file contents to standard input from a file
# Example:
# create a file and put line 1 on in it, see what's in it and add more lines
echo "line 1" > myfile.txt

# REDIRECT OUTPUT BY OVERWRITING A FILE
# redirect standard erro to an error file
# example: if type garbage in terminal, it will return an error, put that error in an error_file.txt
garbage 2> error_file.txt
cat error_file.txt
# Example 2:
ls > files.txt will create a file called files.txt if it doesn't exist, and write the output of the ls command to it.

# REDIRECT OUTPUT BY APPENDING TO A FILE
# example:
ls >> files.txt will append the output of the ls command to the files.txt file if it exists or will create it it if not

# REDIRECT STANDARD ERROR OUTPUT (2>)
# used to redirect standard error output of a command to a file
# example:
ls non-existent-file 2> error_file.txt
# This will redirect the error message to error_file.txt instead of displaying it on the terminal. Will overwrite if it exists

# APPEND STANDARD ERROR OUTPUT (2>>)
# used to append standard error output of a command to a file
# example:
ls non-existent-file 2>> error_file.txt

# REDIRECT INPUT FROM A FILE (<)
# used to redirect the standard input of a command from a file or another command
# example:
sort < myfile.txt
# This will read the contents of myfile.txt and sort them, displaying the sorted output on the terminal.

# COMMAND SUBSTITUTION ( 2 ways: $(command) or `command` )
# allows you to capture the output of a command and use it as an argument in another command
# denoted by backticks `command` or $(command)
# when the command is executed, the output replaces the command itself
# good for automating tasks and using the output of one command as input to another


# Example: assign the output of a command to a variable using backticks ` `
DATE=`date`
# Example:
# store current directory path in a variable called here
here=$(pwd)
echo "The current directory is $here"
# then echo ( or print) it's value in directory
echo $here

# example 2:
# you could store the path to your current directory in a variable by applying command substitution on the pwd command, then move to another
# directory, and finally return to your original directory by invoking the cd command on the variable you stored, as follows:
$ here=$(pwd)
$ cd path_to_some_other_directory
$ cd $here

# COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
# a way to pass arguments to a script when executing it

# BATCH MODE VERSUS CONCURRENT MODE
# Batch mode runs sequentially, one command at a time in order
# example: command1; command2 ( command2 will only run after command1 completes)
# Command Mode runs in parallel, multiple commands at the same time
# example: command1 & command2 ( command1 and command2 will run at the same
 # command1 runs in the background and then passes command to command2


# BASH SCRIPT CONDITIONALS ( if, then, else, elif)
if [ condition ]
then
    statement_block_1
else
    statement_block_2
fi

# Tips:
# You must always put spaces around your condition within the square brackets [ ].
# Every if condition block must be paired with a fi to tell Bash where the condition block ends.
# The else block is optional but recommended. If the condition evaluates to false without an else block, then nothing happens within the if condition block.
# onsider options such as echoing a comment in statement_block_2 to indicate that the condition was evaluated as false.


# example, the condition is checking whether the number of command-line arguments read by some Bash script, $#, is equal to 2.
if [[ $# == 2 ]]
then
  echo "number of arguments is equal to 2"
else
  echo "number of arguments is not equal to 2"
fi

# string comparisons. For example, assume you have a variable called string_var that has the value "Yes" assigned to it.
# Then the following statement evaluates to true
if [[ $string_var == "Yes" ]]
then
  echo "string_var is equal to Yes"
else
  echo "string_var is not equal to Yes"
fi

# Multiple conditions
if [ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]
then
    echo "conditions 1 and 2 are both true"
else
    echo "one or both conditions are false"
fi

if [ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ]
then
    echo "conditions 1 or 2 are true"
else
    echo "both conditions are false"
fi

# Logical operators
$a == 2
# if variable a has a value of 2, then the condition evaluates to true
a != 2
# if variable a does not have a value of 2, then the condition evaluates to true
a <= 3
# if variable a has a value less than or equal to 3, then the condition evaluates to true

# Alternatively, you can use the equivalent notation -le in place of <=:
a=1
b=2
if [ $a -le $b ]
then
   echo "a is less than or equal to b"
else
   echo "a is not less than or equal to b"
fi

# ARITHMETIC CALCULATIONS WITH NOTATION $(())
echo $((3+2))
OR
a=3
b=2
c=$(($a+$b))
echo $c

# NOTE: Bash natively handles integer arithmetic but does not handle floating-point arithmetic.
# As a result, it will always truncate the decimal portion of a calculation result.
echo $((3/2))
#prints the truncated integer result, 1, not the floating-point number, 1.5

# ARRAYS IN BASH
# The array is a Bash built-in data structure. An array is a space-delimited list contained in parentheses.ÊŠTo create an array,
# declare its name and contents:
my_array=(1 2 "three" "four" 5)
