To locate the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file on your system, you can use the following methods depending on your operating system.

---

### **Option 1: Use the Command Line to Search for the File**

#### **Linux/MacOS**
1. Open your terminal.
2. Use the `find` command to search for the file:
   ```bash
   find ~/.jupyter -name "jupyter_notebook_config.py"
   ```
   - This command searches for the file in the default Jupyter configuration directory (`~/.jupyter`).
   - If you don't find it there, search your entire system:
     ```bash
     sudo find / -name "jupyter_notebook_config.py" 2>/dev/null
     ```

#### **Windows**
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Use the `dir` command to search for the file:
   ```cmd
   dir /s /p "jupyter_notebook_config.py"
   ```
   - This searches the current directory and its subdirectories.
3. If you're not sure where to start, search the entire drive (e.g., `C:`):
   ```cmd
   dir C:\ /s /p "jupyter_notebook_config.py"
   ```

---

### **Option 2: Check the Default Jupyter Configuration Directory**
The `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file is typically located in one of the following directories:

#### **Linux/MacOS**
- `~/.jupyter/`
- `/home/<username>/.jupyter/`

#### **Windows**
- `C:\Users\<username>\.jupyter\`

You can manually navigate to these directories using your file explorer.

---

### **Option 3: Use Jupyter to Locate the Configuration Directory**
If you're unsure where Jupyter is looking for its configuration files, you can use the following command:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run this command to list the Jupyter configuration directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter --config-dir
   ```
   This will output the directory where `jupyter_notebook_config.py` should be located (e.g., `~/.jupyter/`).

---

### **Option 4: Generate the Configuration File (If It Doesn't Exist)**
If you can't find the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file, it may not have been created yet. You can generate it manually:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook --generate-config
   ```
   This will create the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file in the default Jupyter configuration directory (e.g., `~/.jupyter/` or `C:\Users\<username>\.jupyter\`).

3. After generating the file, navigate to the directory to locate it.

---

### **Example Output of `jupyter --config-dir`**
If you run:
```bash
jupyter --config-dir
```
You might see:
```
/home/username/.jupyter
```
In this case, the file should be located at `/home/username/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`.
