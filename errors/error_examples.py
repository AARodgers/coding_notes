The error you're encountering, **"A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame,"** happens when you're working with a **view** (a subset of the original DataFrame) rather than a **copy** of the DataFrame, and you try to modify it. This is a common issue in pandas and is related to how it handles slicing and indexing.

### Why This Happens:
When you create a subset of a DataFrame (e.g., using filtering or slicing), pandas may return a **view** of the original DataFrame instead of a completely independent copy. If you then try to modify this subset, pandas raises this warning to let you know that your changes might not affect the original DataFrame in the way you expect.

### Example of the Problem:
```python
# Original DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'rtn': [123456789, 987654321, 123450000], 'value': [1, 2, 3]})

# Create a subset (this might be a view, not a copy)
subset = df[df['value'] > 1]

# Try to modify the subset
subset['is_value'] = subset['rtn'].astype(str).apply(validate_routing_number)
# Warning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
```

---

### How to Fix It:
To avoid this warning, you should explicitly use `.loc` or ensure you're working with a copy of the DataFrame. Below are the two most common solutions:

---

#### **Solution 1: Use `.loc` to Modify the Original DataFrame**
`.loc` allows you to specify the rows and columns you want to modify directly in the original DataFrame.

```python
df.loc[df['value'] > 1, 'is_value'] = df.loc[df['value'] > 1, 'rtn'].astype(str).apply(validate_routing_number)
```

- **What This Does**:
  - `df.loc[df['value'] > 1, 'is_value']`: Selects the rows where `value > 1` and the column `is_value`.
  - Assigns the result of the transformation (`validate_routing_number`) to those rows in the original DataFrame.

---

#### **Solution 2: Work with a Copy**
If you want to work with a subset of the DataFrame without modifying the original, explicitly create a copy of the subset.

```python
subset = df[df['value'] > 1].copy()
subset['is_value'] = subset['rtn'].astype(str).apply(validate_routing_number)
```

- **What This Does**:
  - `.copy()` ensures that `subset` is an independent copy of the original DataFrame.
  - You can safely modify `subset` without affecting `df` or triggering warnings.

---

#### **Which Solution Should You Use?**
- Use **Solution 1** if you want to modify the original DataFrame (`df`).
- Use **Solution 2** if you want to work with a subset of the DataFrame without affecting the original.

---

### Additional Notes:
- The warning doesn't always mean something is broken—it’s just a heads-up that your changes might not behave as expected. However, it's a good practice to fix it to avoid unintended side effects.
- If you're unsure whether you're working with a view or a copy, you can use `.is_copy` to check:
  ```python
  print(subset._is_copy)
