-- After completing this reading, you will be able to:

-- Understand the Role of SQLite in Datasette
-- Create and Manage Data Tables
-- Implement Views for Simplified Data Access
-- Optimize Query Performance with Indexes
-- Datasette is a versatile tool designed for exploring and publishing SQLite databases.
-- It enables users to create intuitive web interfaces for SQLite databases, facilitating
-- easy data browsing and querying without the need for additional programming.

-- Key Concepts
-- SQLite: SQLite is a lightweight, disk-based database engine that operates without a separate server process.
-- Its simplicity and ease of setup make it ideal for local applications and development environments.

-- Views: Views are virtual tables derived from SQL query results. Views simplify complex queries,
-- facilitate query reuse, and present data in specific formats without altering the underlying tables.

-- Indexes: Indexes are database objects that enhance data retrieval speed. By creating a separate
-- data structure, indexes enable the database engine to locate rows more efficiently than performing a
-- full table scan.

-- Real-World Scenario: Managing an E-commerce Inventory
-- Scenario: Imagine you are managing an e-commerce platform that sells a variety of products.
-- Your goal is to create a database to track inventory, including product details and sales information.
-- You want to optimize the database to quickly access and analyze data.
