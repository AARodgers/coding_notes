Now you can determine how many hours difference there are between your system's local time and that of Casablanca.
In this example, the local time (11:28) is 5 hours behind UTC (16:28). Therefore, the system's time zone (EST) has an offset of UTC-5.

Now, calculate the time difference between your system and Casablanca:
Casablanca is at UTC+1.Your system is at UTC-5.The time difference is calculated as: (Casablanca UTC offset) - (Your System UTC offset).
This is: (+1) - (-5) = 6 hours.
This means Casablanca time is 6 hours ahead of your system's time.
Thus, to run your script at noon Casablanca time (12:00 UTC+1), you need to run it at 6:00 AM your system time (EST).
12:00 in Casablanca minus 6 hours = 06:00 (6 AM) on your system.
