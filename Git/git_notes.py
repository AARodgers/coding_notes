Untracked files in Git are files that are not being tracked by Git (i.e., they haven't been added to the staging area). Since Git does not track changes in untracked files, you cannot use Git commands like `git diff` directly to see changes in untracked files. However, you can still inspect the contents of untracked files manually or compare them to other versions if available.

Here are ways to see the changes in untracked files:

---

### **1. Manually Open the File**
- Open the untracked file in a text editor or IDE to view its contents.
- Compare it manually with other files or versions if necessary.

---

### **2. Use `git diff` with `--no-index`**
Git's `diff` command normally compares tracked files, but you can use the `--no-index` option to compare an untracked file against another file or directory.

#### Example:
```bash
git diff --no-index untracked_file.txt reference_file.txt
```

- **`untracked_file.txt`**: The untracked file.
- **`reference_file.txt`**: Another file to compare against (e.g., a previously saved version).

#### Output:
Git will show the differences between the two files.

---

### **3. Temporarily Add the File to Git**
If you want Git to track the changes in an untracked file, you can temporarily add it to the staging area and use `git diff`:

#### Steps:
1. **Stage the File**:
   ```bash
   git add untracked_file.txt
   ```

2. **Use `git diff`**:
   ```bash
   git diff --staged
   ```

3. **Unstage the File** (if you don't want to keep it tracked):
   ```bash
   git reset untracked_file.txt
   ```

---

### **4. Compare Against a Backup or Saved Version**
If you have a backup or saved version of the file (e.g., from a previous commit or another directory), you can use `diff` directly:

#### Example:
```bash
diff untracked_file.txt backup_file.txt
```

---

### **5. Inspect Untracked Files Using External Tools**
Use external tools like `meld`, `diff`, or IDEs with built-in Git support to compare the untracked file against other files or versions.

#### Example with `meld`:
```bash
meld untracked_file.txt reference_file.txt
```

---

### **Summary**
- Git does not track changes in untracked files directly.
- Use `git diff --no-index` to compare untracked files manually.
- Temporarily stage the file with `git add` to use `git diff`.
- Compare the file against a backup or reference version using tools like `diff` or `meld`.

If you're working with important untracked files, consider adding them to Git or creating backups for easier comparison and management.
