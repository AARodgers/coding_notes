# Python Script:
# Definition:

# A Python script is a file containing Python code that is intended to be executed as a standalone program.
# Purpose:

# Scripts are typically used to perform a specific task or a sequence of tasks. They are often written to automate processes, perform data analysis, or run a series of commands.
# Execution:

# Python scripts are executed from the command line or an integrated development environment (IDE). The code runs from top to bottom, and once it completes, the script terminates.

# script.py
print("This is a Python script.")
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# To run the script, you would use the command:
python script.py
